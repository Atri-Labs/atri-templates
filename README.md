# Atri Templates
Common requirements in frontend that are packaged in ready-to-use form. 

For example, responsive navigation bar with three columns is shown below. 

[File location](templates/basics/responsive_navigation_bar.json)

Find the complete list and details of available templates [here](templates/README.md).

## How to use a template?

1. Copy contents of the JSON file from this repository. 

For example, if you want to use `responsive_navigation_bar` template in `atri-templates/templates/basics/responsive_navigation_bar.json`, visit the link and copy its contents by clicking on the `Copy raw contents` icon in GitHub. 

2. Create a new JSON file inside a corresponding folder (e.g. `basics`, `layout`, etc.) in `atri_templates` directory in your Atri app root directory. 

Continuing with our example, create a `atri-templates/basics/responsive_navigation_bar.json` and paste the contents of the file here. 

We will be releasing a CLI in our future versions to make this process easier. Stay tuned!
